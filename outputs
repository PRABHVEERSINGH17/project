Certainly! Let's go through the provided C code step by step to understand its behavior and output.

### Code Explanation

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 65;      // Step 1: Declare and initialize an integer variable i with the value 65
    char j = 'A';    // Step 2: Declare and initialize a character variable j with the character 'A'

    if (i == j) {    // Step 3: Compare the integer i with the character j
        printf("C is WOW\n");  // Step 4: If i and j are equal, print "C is WOW"
    } else {
        printf("C is headache"); // Step 5: If i and j are not equal, print "C is headache"
    }

    return 0;        // Step 6: Return 0 to indicate successful completion of the program
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Header File Inclusion:**
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   ```
   This line includes the standard I/O library which is required for using `printf` and `scanf`.

2. **Main Function Declaration:**
   ```c
   int main() {
   ```
   This is the entry point of the program. Execution starts here.

3. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```c
   int i = 65;
   char j = 'A';
   ```
   - `i` is an integer variable set to `65`.
   - `j` is a character variable initialized with `'A'`.

4. **Comparison of `i` and `j`:**
   ```c
   if (i == j) {
   ```
   - In C, characters are internally represented as integers based on their ASCII values.
   - The ASCII value of the character `'A'` is `65`.
   - Therefore, `j` is implicitly converted to its ASCII value (`65`) during the comparison.
   - So, `i` (which is `65`) is compared to `j` (which is also `65` after conversion). Hence, `i == j` evaluates to `true`.

5. **Conditional Output:**
   - **If the condition is true (`i == j`):**
     ```c
     printf("C is WOW\n");
     ```
     This line is executed and prints `"C is WOW"`, followed by a newline.

   - **If the condition were false:**
     ```c
     printf("C is headache");
     ```
     This line would execute instead, printing `"C is headache"`.

6. **Return Statement:**
   ```c
   return 0;
   ```
   - This signifies that the `main` function completes successfully and returns `0` to the operating system.

### Output

Given that `i` and `j` both represent the value `65`, the condition `i == j` evaluates to `true`. Thus, the output of this program will be:

```
C is WOW
```

### Summary

- **Character to Integer Conversion:** In C, when comparing a character and an integer, the character is converted to its ASCII value for the comparison. In this case, `'A'` converts to `65`, so the comparison `i == j` (where `i` is also `65`) evaluates to true.
- **Program Behavior:** The program prints `"C is WOW"` because the condition `i == j` is true.

The program effectively demonstrates the implicit type conversion between characters and integers in C.
